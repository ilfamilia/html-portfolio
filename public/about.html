<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Israel Liranzo. I was born and raised in the Dominican Republic. 
  I am a programmer who specializes mainly in the creation of web pages.</p>

<p>I like to do things with a minimalist approach, I think that the simple usually has a subtle beauty that few know how to appreciate, 
  I try to add that style to my web pages.</p>
